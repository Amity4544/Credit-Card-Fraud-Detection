**Project Title: Credit Card Transaction Fraud Detection using Machine Learning**

**Project Description:**

The objective of this machine learning project is to develop a robust classification model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset provided contains a comprehensive set of features related to credit card transactions, including transaction details, customer information, merchant details, and indicators of fraudulent activity.

**Project Goals:**

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**
   - Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of features.
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and perform feature engineering as needed.
   - Visualize relationships between features to gain insights.

2. **Feature Selection:**
   - Identify relevant features that contribute to fraud detection.
   - Evaluate feature importance and correlation.

3. **Model Development:**
   - Implement machine learning algorithms for classification.
   - Train and optimize the model using the training set.
   - Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, etc.).


This project aims to provide a reliable and interpretable model for credit card fraud detection, contributing to the ongoing efforts to enhance financial transaction security.
