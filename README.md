# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
The provided information describes the attributes in the dataset for credit card transactions, specifically for training a model to detect credit card fraud. The dataset appears to contain various features related to the transactions, cardholders, merchants, and other relevant details. Here's an overview of each attribute:

- **index:** A unique identifier for each row in the dataset.
- **trans_date_trans_time:** The timestamp of the transaction.
- **cc_num:** Credit card number of the customer.
- **merchant:** Name of the merchant involved in the transaction.
- **category:** Category of the merchant.
- **amt:** Amount of the transaction.
- **first:** First name of the credit card holder.
- **last:** Last name of the credit card holder.
- **gender:** Gender of the credit card holder.
- **street:** Street address of the credit card holder.
- **city:** City of the credit card holder.
- **state:** State of the credit card holder.
- **zip:** Zip code of the credit card holder.
- **lat:** Latitude location of the credit card holder.
- **long:** Longitude location of the credit card holder.
- **city_pop:** Population of the credit card holder's city.
- **job:** Job of the credit card holder.
- **dob:** Date of birth of the credit card holder.
- **trans_num:** Transaction number.
- **unix_time:** UNIX timestamp of the transaction.
- **merch_lat:** Latitude location of the merchant.
- **merch_long:** Longitude location of the merchant.
- **is_fraud:** Fraud flag, indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (target class).

This dataset seems to be designed for training a machine learning model to predict whether a given credit card transaction is fraudulent or not. The features provide information about the transaction, cardholder, merchant, and location, while the "is_fraud" attribute serves as the target variable for classification. The dataset likely requires preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of classification algorithms to develop an effective credit card fraud detection model.
